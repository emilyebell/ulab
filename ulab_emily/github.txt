1. Someone plops you into the middle of this directory system. What command will allow you to know what your absolute path is?
pwd: print working directory
2. Your terminal tells you that ̃/music/ is your absolute path. What command will allow you view all of the directories and files inside of ̃/music/? What files should be listed?
Running the ls command allows you to view all directories and files inside /music/. The files that should be listed are patterns.txt and symmetry.py 						
3. What command(s) will allow you to open up patterns.txt inside of ̃/music/ and edit the file?
nano patterns.txt				
4. What command will allow you to print the file on your terminal instead of opening it up in a text editor?
cat patterns.txt 						
5. Bonus: What command will allow you to see the difference between patterns.txt and symmetry.txt?
diff patterns.txt symmetry.py			
6. What command will allow you to move patterns.txt to ̃/math/calculus/?
mv ~/music/patterns.txt ~/math/calculus/ 						
7. What command will allow you to remove triangle.txt from ̃/math/geometry?
rm ~/math/geometry/triangle.txt		
8. The file patterns.txt is now only located at ̃/math/calculus/patterns .txt. What singular command will allow you (the user) to move from  ̃/music/ to ̃/math/? (Hint: What is your relative path to ̃/math/?)
cd ../math					
9. Your absolute path is now ̃/math/. What command would make math/ a local git repository?
git init					
10. The math/ directory is now a local git repository. How would you connect your local math/ repository with a remote math/ repository?
git remote add origin *insert URL*						
11. Your local math/ repository is now connected to a remote one. What command will allow you to copy symmetry.txt from ̃/music/ to your local math/ repository?
cp ~/music/symmetry.py ~/math/
 						
12. What command will allow you to view the current state of your working directory and staging area? Is git currently tracking symmetry.txt, why or why not?
git status
Git is not currently tracking symmetry.txt as it has not been added, committed, and pushed to the remote repository 	
13. What command adds only the copy of symmetry.txt to your math/ staging area? What command adds all changes to all files and directories to your staging area?
Adds only the copy of symmetry.txt: git add symmetry.txt
Adds all changes to all files and directories: git add .		
14. The file symmetry.txt is now in your staging area. Is git currently tracking symmetry.txt? Bonus: What command would allow you to unstage symmetry.txt?
Yes, once symmetry.txt is in the staging area, Git is tracking it. To unstage symmetry.txt: git restore --staged symmetry.py 						
15. What command will allow you to commit your staged files to your local repository? Include the message.
git commit -m “Commit staged files to local repo”			
16. Your staged files have now been committed to your local repository. What command will allow you to push your local repository to your remote repository. What branch should you be pushing to? Why?	
git push origin master
You push to master because no other branch has been specified so we cna assume it is in the default branch.
17. What command will allow you to make a new branch off of math/ called applied math?
git branch applied-math 						
18. What command will allow you to move into the applied math branch?
git checkout applied-math			
19. You are now located inside of the applied math branch. You make a new directory called physics/ and inside of that directory you make a file called mechanics.txt with some fun facts in it. How would you push all of these changes to your remote repository? What would happen if you switched back to your original branch before committing these changes?
git add physics/
git commit -m "Add physics/ directory and mechanics.txt"
git push origin applied-math
If you switch back to your original branch before committing these changes you will discard any uncommitted changes in your working directory.					
20. What command will list all of your branches? What branch will be currently highlighted in green?
git branch
The applied-math branch will be highlighted in green						
21. What command will allow you to move back to your original branch?
git checkout master 						
22. Bonus: What command will allow you to combine applied math with your original branch?
git merge applied-math					
23. Make a tree diagram of your directory system (with all the files and folders) after working through this problem. Specify which directories are repositories and what the branch of a repository will look like. Take a screenshot or a photo (if you drew it by hand) and save it. You will need it for later.
